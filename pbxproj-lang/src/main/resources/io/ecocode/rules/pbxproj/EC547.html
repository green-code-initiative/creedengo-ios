    Dark Mode was introduced in iOS 13.
    It allows the user to switch its system to a dark mode and the apps inherits it automatically by default.
    Yet is possible to overrides it to light mode by setting the value <code>Light</code> for the key <code>UIUserInterfaceStyle</code> in the Information Property List.
    This should be avoided since displaying dark colors has a significant impact on energy consumption for mobile devices with OLED screens.

    The value for the key <code>UIUserInterfaceStyle</code> must be <code>Automatic</code> or this key must be removed from the Information Property List.
